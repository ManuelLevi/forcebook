## The strongest and tallest buildings all start with a strong foundation.

Foundation is the backbone of the entire data strategy. 

A strong Foundation consists of five key ideas: 

* [Goals and Alignment]({{< relref "alignment.md" >}} "Goals and Alignment");
* [Initatives]({{< relref "initiatives.md" >}} "Initatives");
* [Technology]({{< relref "technology.md" >}} "Technology");
* [Documentation]({{< relref "documentation.md" >}} "Documentation");
* [Single Source of Truth]({{< relref "ssot.md" >}} "Single Source of Truth").

Each these is necessary for the successful development of a data strategy. Without a competent, well-grounded Foundation, we cannot confidently advance to the other four pillars.

At the end of the chapter you'll also find a [use case]({{< relref "foundation_use_case.md" >}} "Foundation Use Case") to help you understand how these ideas can be put to practice.
